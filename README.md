NOTWORDLE

Simple Wordle simulation using C++. Allows user to upload a custom word-list of 5-letter words. Defaults to 'word_list.txt'. Two sample lists are included in this repository. User have 5 chances to correctly guess the 5-letter word. If a letter is guessed correctly, it turns green. If the letter exists in the word but is not placed in the correct position, it turns yellow. 

User is asked if they would like to upload a word list, or use the default list:
